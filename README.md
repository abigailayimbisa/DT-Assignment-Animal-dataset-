# Decision Tree Assignment - Animal Dataset

This repository contains an assignment designed to test and practice knowledge on the use of Decision Trees (DTrees). The primary focus is on training a Decision Tree model using an animal dataset to predict whether an animal is a mammal or not.

## Contents

Google Colab Notebook: A comprehensive notebook that walks through the entire process of training the Decision Tree model.
Animal Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the model, containing various features of animals.
  
## Objective

The main objective of this assignment is to predict if an animal is a mammal or not based on its features using a Decision Tree model.

## Instructions

1. Load the Data: Import and explore the animal dataset.
2. Preprocess the Data: Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the Model: Use a Decision Tree classifier to train the model on the training set.
4. Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics on the test set.
5. Predict: Use the trained model to predict whether an animal is a mammal or not.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DT-Assignment-Animal-dataset.git
    ```
2. Open the Google Colab notebook in the repository.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the Decision Tree model.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab (optional but recommended for running the notebook)

## Conclusion

By completing this assignment, I gained practical experience in using Decision Trees for classification tasks, specifically in predicting mammalian status from various animal features.
